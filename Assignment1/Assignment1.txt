1) Make a directory Assignment1 under cs131 directory and change it. All your homework for this assignment will be done there.

cd cs131

mkdir Assignment1

2) Echo your current Shell using the global variable and paste the output of the command.  Which commands did you use?

Echo your home directory path and paste the output of the command.  Which commands did you use?

Input                                    Output

I used the id command

Output: uid=1221(dylansp24) gid=1221(dylansp24) groups=1221(dylansp24),78(S78)

4) Create a new directory "myDir" under the Assignment 1 folder. Now remove "write" permission for yourself.(see chmod man page) 

From this temp directory, are you allowed to cd in that directory? Can you "ls" it?  Can you "ls -l" it? Can you create files under it?

I can cd into myDir

I can ls and ls -1

I cannot create files under it

5) Create a new directory "myDir2" and create a new directory "myDir3" 

done
6) Inside myDir2, create a file "myFile.txt" (use 'touch' or 'vi' command). Once done, move this file from myDir2 to myDir3 using the mv command.

done using touch

Mem: 71367 32361 19854   3561     19151          33986
